This project includes two initial and cleaned releases: A [dataset on knowledge specialists in 55 societies](https://github.com/alightner/conceptualExpertsHRAF), and a [dataset on medicinal specialists in 47 societies](https://github.com/alightner/ethnomedicine-magic).

Each dataset comes from a larger database that I created from the electronic Human Relations Area Files World Cultures database. All data were coded and cross-checked by [Cynthiann Heckelsmiller](https://twitter.com/Cynthiann_H/) and me from the ethnographic texts in the eHRAF.

These are from a an ongoing project, [The Evolution of Science and Religion as Adaptive Knowledge Specialization](https://github.com/alightner/evorelsci). This project is a contribution to a larger interdisciplinary effort by the Issachar Fund and Templeton Religion Trust.

For some background about one of the first studies we conducted with this dataset, check out a [post that I wrote](/post/knowledge-specialists/) about it.

Here are the publications associated with this data release: [Ethnoscientific expertise and knowledge specialisation in 55 traditional cultures](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/ethnoscientific-expertise-and-knowledge-specialisation-in-55-traditional-cultures/00756899A412BE98809E1A03C3307C99), published in *Evolutionary Human Sciences*, and [Ethnomedical specialists and their supernatural theories of expertise](https://psyarxiv.com/gbamc/), published in *Review of Philosophy and Psychology*.
