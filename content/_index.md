Hi there :wave:

I'm Aaron Lightner, a social and behavioral researcher. My expertise is in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology, and I study how people make sense of their social and natural worlds.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of the Study of Religion and the [Religion, Cognition, and Culture Lab](https://rcc.au.dk/) at Aarhus University.
